# Professor Course Assignment Platform (PCAP)

## Overview

The **Professor Course Assignment Platform (PCAP)** is a Java-based system designed to efficiently manage and match professors to courses within the Computer Science Department at LaSalle College. The platform features advanced data structures, including a priority queue, to optimize professor assignments based on seniority and requested hours, while also handling course and professor representations.

## Description
### Features
- **Generic Circular Queue:** Implements a circular queue with array and linked list representations, with methods to handle standard queue operations as well as priority queue functionality.

- **Priority Queue:** Extends the generic queue to handle priority-based operations, including enqueuing based on priority, and displaying elements by priority.

- **Professor Representation:** Models professors with attributes such as ID, name, seniority, hiring date, disciplines, and affected courses. Implements comparison based on seniority and hire date.

- **Course Representation:** Models courses with attributes like ID, title, discipline, number of hours, and number of groups. Includes a copy constructor.

- **Department Representation:** Manages a collection of courses and professors, with methods for course assignment based on professor preferences and constraints.

- **Matching Algorithm:** Efficiently assigns courses to professors based on their preferences, available courses, and constraints like maximum weekly hours and discipline match.

## Technology Used
- **Java:** The core programming language used for implementing the data structures, classes, and algorithms.
- **JavaDocs:** For generating documentation.
- **JAR Files:** For packaging the application.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Viraj5903/Professor_Course_Assignment_Platform.git
   ```
2. **Ensure Java is Installed:**
   - Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/).

3. **Open in IDE:**
    - Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

4. **Build the Project:**
    - **Compile:** Use your IDE's build tool or run javac commands to compile the source code.
    - **Generate JAR Files:** Use the build tools provided by your IDE or the command line.

5. **Run the Main Application:**
   - Execute the Main.java file to process professor preferences and course availability.
